 + CSA-Enhanced-Operations/index.jsp 						
 + CSA-Enhanced-Operations/README.md
 + CSA-Enhanced-Operations/setup.json

3. Add the corresponding entry to the csa.war/dashboard/config.json depending on the installed csa version.
  (inside main.tiles array or in sub panel see **CSA Configuration guide** if unsure how to manipulate this file)

  **CSA 4.2**
  ```JSON
  	{
  		"id": "CSA-Enhanced-Operations",
  		"name": "CSA-Enhanced-Operations",
  		"description": "CSA-Enhanced-Operations_description",
  		"enabled": true,
  		"style": "custom-tile-header",
  		"target": "iframe",
  		"data": "/csa/custom-content/CSA-Enhanced-Operations/",
  		"helptopic": "console_help",
  		"roles": ["CSA_ADMIN"]
  	}
  ```
  **CSA 4.6+**
  ```JSON
  	{
  		"id": "CSA-Enhanced-Operations",
  		"name": "CSA-Enhanced-Operations",
  		"description": "CSA-Enhanced-Operations_description",
  		"enabled": true,
  		"style": "custom-tile-header",
  		"type": "iframe",
  		"url": "/csa/custom-content/CSA-Enhanced-Operations/",
  		"helptopic": "console_help",
  		"roles": ["CSA_ADMIN"]
  	}
  ```

4. Open the file **csa.war/dashboard/messages/common/messages.properties** and navigate to the section entitled:
  ```
  # Page titles and descriptions, used for the dashboard tiles and for navigation views
  ```
  Add the following entries

  ```JSON
  	CSA-Enhanced-Operations=Enhanced Operations
  	CSA-Enhanced-Operations_description=This experimental feature allows a Super User to
  	Manage Subscriptions across all organizations efficiently (Experimental)
  ```

5. To fix the CSA styling on the dashboard you can add the following css snippet to the end of the file **csa.war/dashboard/css/base.css**. This will prevent the text from overlaying when viewing the dashboard on smaller viewports.

  ```CSS
  	.tile h3 {
  		white-space:inherit;
  		font-size:1.4em;
  	}
  ```

6. As the plugin is installed to a custom directory in the csa webapp it's a good idea to add an intercept-url directive to the ```applicationContext-security.xml```. Adding such a rule will check the user accessing the url is already authenticated with CSA. When the session is not authenticated the directive will redirect them to the login page. Adding the below mentioned directive will prevent exceptions being thrown and errors being output in the csa.log.
  ```xml
  <intercept-url access="isAuthenticated()" pattern="/custom-content/**"/>
  ```

7. Configure the settings in **csa.war/custom-content/CSA-Enhanced-Operations/setup.json**

#### Optional: SQL Query and Column Customization
---

The datatable sources it's dataset from SQL queries defined in the folder **/pages/sql/** When the SQL queries are modified to return additional/alternative fields then the columns definition inside the setup.json file must also be updated.

The dataset returned from the SQL query is parsed into a JSON object in a format which is directly consumed by the datatable. any column names returned from the query are capitalised to ensure standardisation between different RDBMS.

The column definitions should look as follows

```JSON
[
    {"title": "Subscription Name",     "data": "SUBSCRIPTION_NAME" },
    {"title": "Icon",                  "data": "ICON_URL",          "class":"text-center" },
    {"title": "Instance Name",         "data": "INSTANCE_NAME"},
    {"title": "Owner Group",           "data": "SUBCRIPTION_OWNER_GROUP"}        
]
```

Each entry in the Object Array denotes a single column in the datatable, The title attribute is contains the display name of the field, the data attribute contains the name of the field in the JSON object returned by the SQL query (important this is always capital), The class field can contain the following:
- **text-center** - Jusitfies the column in the center.
- **text-left** - Justifies the column to the left.
- **text-right** - Justifies the column to the right.
- **none** - Hides the column from the table and only displays it in the drill down summary.
