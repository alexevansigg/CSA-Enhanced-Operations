3. Add the corresponding entry to the csa.war/dashboard/config.json depending on the installed csa version.
  (inside main.tiles array or in sub panel see **CSA Configuration guide** if unsure how to manipulate this file)
  
  **CSA 4.2**
  ```JSON
  	{
  		"id": "CSA-Enhanced-Operations",
  		"name": "CSA-Enhanced-Operations",
  		"description": "CSA-Enhanced-Operations_description",
  		"enabled": true,
  		"style": "custom-tile-header",
  		"target": "iframe",
  		"data": "/csa/custom-content/CSA-Enhanced-Operations/",
  		"helptopic": "console_help",
  		"roles": ["CSA_ADMIN"]
  	}
  ```
  **CSA 4.6+**
  ```JSON 
  	{
  		"id": "CSA-Enhanced-Operations",
  		"name": "CSA-Enhanced-Operations",
  		"description": "CSA-Enhanced-Operations_description",
  		"enabled": true,
  		"style": "custom-tile-header",
  		"type": "iframe",
  		"url": "/csa/custom-content/CSA-Enhanced-Operations/",
  		"helptopic": "console_help",
  		"roles": ["CSA_ADMIN"]
  	}
  ```

4. Open the file **csa.war/dashboard/messages/common/messages.properties** and navigate to the section entitled:
  ```
  # Page titles and descriptions, used for the dashboard tiles and for navigation views
  ```
  Add the following entries

  ```JSON
  	CSA-Enhanced-Operations=Enhanced Operations
  	CSA-Enhanced-Operations_description=This experimental feature allows a Super User to
  	Manage Subscriptions across all organizations efficiently (Experimental)
  ```

5. To fix the CSA styling on the dashboard you can add the following css snippet to the end of the file **csa.war/dashboard/css/base.css**. This will prevent the text from overlaying when viewing the dashboard on smaller viewports.

  ```CSS
  	.tile h3 {
  		white-space:inherit;
  		font-size:1.4em;
  	}
  ```

6. Configure the settings in csa.war/custom-content/CSA-Enhanced-Operations/setup.json

	Name | Description  | Default
	------------- | ------------- |-------------
	MPP_HOST 					| The url of a MPP instance, Required for Consumer Admin Links  | https://localhost:8089/
	DATA_URL 					| The path to the URL for retrieving the Subscriptions          | pages/getSubs.jsp
	ENABLE_CONSUMER_ADMIN_LINKS | Set as false to disable direct links to Manage Subscriptions as Consumer Admin | true
	ENABLE_CANCEL_LINKS 		| Set as false to disable Cancel subscription functionality  | true
	ENABLE_RESUME_LINKS			| Set as false to disable resuming paused subscription functionality | true
	ENABLE_DELETE_LINKS			| Set as false to disable deleting offline subscription functionality | true
	REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION		| Set as false to determine the default behaviour regarding confirmation prompts | true
	SHOW_RETIRED				| Choose whether to include retired artifacts by default | false
	USE_FIXED_HEADER			| Set as false to disable the fixed header behaviour | true
  CACHE_NAME            | The name of the http cookie used for storing user preferences | CSA-E-O-Conf
	CONFIG_CACHE				| Integer representing the number of days end user configuration remain in browser cache | 5
  DEFAULT_DISPLAY_LENGTH    | Set the Default number of rows should be displayed, possible values 10,25,50 or ALL | 25
	SEARCH_TERM					| The default value set in the Datatables search field | "<Empty String>"
  ADVANCED_SEARCH   | The default setting for the individual column search field | true
	COLUMNS						| An object array of columns show in the datatable, the order here is the default order the columns show in, the titles represent the column headers, the data values should not be changed, add/remove the call "none" to move the column into the child row (drill down). | 


7. As the plugin is installed to a custom directory in the csa webapp it's a good idea to add an intercept-url directive to the ```applicationContext-security.xml```. Adding such a rule will check the user accessing the url is allready authenticated with CSA, if its not an authenticated session it will redirect them to the login page. 
The plugin itself is allready trying to check the users roles via the script defined in the previous step (user.jsp). But this expects an authenticated user. Adding the below mentioned directive will prevent exceptions being thrown and errors written in the csa.log.
  ```xml
  <intercept-url access="isAuthenticated()" pattern="/custom-content/**"/>
  ```
